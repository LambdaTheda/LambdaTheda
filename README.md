### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Theda! 
    I am a visionary creator studying Data Science and Full Stack Computer Programming.  As a staunch environmentalist, I started an Upcycling Program in my community, and aim to improve the plights of living beings in any way I can! I dream of Robots, Adaptive Devices, producing those or everyday household goods, inventing or/and optimizing anywhere along the supply chain.
