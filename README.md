### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Theda! My Last name is Un-PRO-NOUNCE-a'-bLE to Most!

    I am a visionary creator studying Data Science and Full Stack Computer Programming.  As a staunch environmentalist,
    I started an Upcycling Program in my community, and aim to improve the plights of living beings in any way I can!
    I dream of Robots, Adaptive Devices, producing those or everyday household goods,
    inventing or/and optimizing anywhere along the supply chain.
 
 â€¢ Iâ€™m currently working on CitySpire web Application - (see Pinned Repository below!)
 
      It's an app that analyzes data from cities such as populations, cost of living, rental rates, crime rates, park (walk score), and many  
      other social and economic factors that are important in deciding where someone would like to live.
